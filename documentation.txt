HOW TO DOCUMENT
===============
1. First of all, start by learning quickly how to document stuff in github.
   Use the wiki and make a readme.md.
   Explain there what it is and what it consists of and other stuff
   that developers that would love to use it would ask for.
   Ask for suggestions, feedback, bugs! 

2. Then start to fashion out examples on your own computer.
   3 solid examples.
